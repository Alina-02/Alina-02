I'm a front-end developer specializing in the React framework. I'm looking to expand my knowledge to the back-end and, most importantly, grow as a UX/UI designer to be able to develop full-stack applications. My current stack is based on Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, but I'm looking to expand into Java and SpringBoot once I've solidified my current knowledge.
